# Changes to the main site

## Home page
### 1. Added Google Analytics
I added Google Analytics to the home page of the site.
Although I don't have much intent to use it for business analytics,
I think tracking the traffic of visitors can be a helpful insight since I would be albe to
know how many people have browsed my website, and know if it is actually helping
me in presenting the information I want to show to recruiters.

### 2. Interactive feedback dialog (and all other pages)
when the feedback buttons are clicked, the dialog will pop up and ask users
to enter their name, contact, and feedback.
With Javascript, I can now actually get the input from users and store it
somewhere if I want, so I can see the actual feedback.

### 3. Detail experience layout fixed
Now with more structured CSS, the experience section looks more aligned and clean.
With the use of flexbox and better tag hierachy, the layout is cleaner and easier
to manage.
It is also more responsive to ratio changes, and no more overlap or other weird problems.

### 4. Thrid party Javascript added -- Spotify Web SDK!
Now with Spotify Web SDK included, I can listen to music from Spotify on the browser
without having to install an Spotify app on my desktop.
TODO: hide the token in .gitignore. The current one expired already so no issue there.
TODO: add a little widget of Spotify

### 5. Images format optimization (and all other pages)
Changed all jpeg and png into webp, and made alt text more descriptive.

## Blogs page
### 1. Added Google Analytics (and all other sub pages)
I added Google Analytics to every sub page of the site.
By tracking the traffic of the sub pages, I can get some insights on whether those
information is interesting to others, and if they will actually go to those sub pages
instead of only looking at the information on the home page.

### 2. Link to posts
I make a link to link to the .md flie, which is the actual blog post I wrote.
I think writing posts in Markdown can be faster and more convenient.
I think some next steps here will be to render the .md on the web page, 
implement the search function with tages, and better styles.

### 3. Search for posts (and all other sub pages)
A dialog will pop up when the search button is pressed. With Javascript, it will
read users' input and echo it, and return the search result.
Since no post content is actually up yet, will return empty for now.
Planning on using Algolia for the search function.

## Eats page
### 1. Added Google Analytics
I added Google Analytics to every sub page of the site.
By tracking the traffic of the sub pages, I can get some insights on whether those
information is interesting to others, and if they will actually go to those sub pages
instead of only looking at the information on the home page.

## Travels page
### 1. Added Google Analytics
I added Google Analytics to every sub page of the site.
