# Changes to the main site

## Home page
### 1. Added Google Analytics
I added Google Analytics to the home page of the site.
Although I don't have much intent to use it for business analytics,
I think tracking the traffic of visitors can be a helpful insight since I would be albe to
know how many people have browsed my website, and know if it is actually helping
me in presenting the information I want to show to recruiters.

## Blogs page
### 1. Added Google Analytics
I added Google Analytics to every sub page of the site.
By tracking the traffic of the sub pages, I can get some insights on whether those
information is interesting to others, and if they will actually go to those sub pages
instead of only looking at the information on the home page.

## Eats page

I added Google Analytics to every sub page of the site.
By tracking the traffic of the sub pages, I can get some insights on whether those
information is interesting to others, and if they will actually go to those sub pages
instead of only looking at the information on the home page.
