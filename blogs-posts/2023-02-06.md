“很久以前看學中文的外國人說，他認為「水開了」是很風雅的說法，沸水翻騰，就像花朵盛開。而以中文為母語的人如我，「水開了」不過是日常說法，千萬遍使用過來，很難提煉詩意。

因此想到詞語本身也會磨損，使用過多，就會淪為與針線無異的死物。好像大雪，豐盛落過壹場，消失殆盡。「夜深知雪重，時聞折竹聲。」白居易用這兩句形容千年前唐朝夜裏的壹次落雪。而我有時聽見詞匯在語句裏發出脆響，也是壹種折竹聲，正是詞語最豐饒的時刻。”

Translation in English:
I used to hear Chinese learners saying "water blooms" (meaning water is boiling in Chinese) is very elegent. Water boils like how flowers bloom. However, being a native speaker, it is just one of those daily expressions we use everyday, thus it is hard to feel the elegence in it.

From that, words themselves get washed out. They fall inactive like needles and stiches after used extensively, just like how the snow disappears no matter how heavy it was. "We know how heavy the snow is only when late at night, because we hear the bamboo breaking from time to time." These two sentences were used by poet Bai Juyi to describe a snowy night thousands year before in the Tang Dynasty. I sometimes too, hear the "bamboo breaking" sounds of the words in sentences, which is when the words are at their golden hours.


So I love reading literatures in the languages they were written (well, not necessarily, because I only understand Chinese and English) even though it might take longer. A lot of those "bamboo breaking" sounds of words are lost in the process of translation no matter how skilled the translators are. I found it so hard to translate the above paragraph from Chinese to English. Although most of the words/phrases/characters have accordingly translations in other languages, it can be hard for readers to understand what the writer was thinking when they chose to use xx instead of xx to express yy when they got translated to the same word, and, as a call back, we can't see how in Chinese we say the water "blooms" when it translates to "boils" when we are translating based on the meaning solely.

For so long I have only been thinking how we can help preserve those distincting languages with technology (NLP? ML? DL?), but I have never thought about how those "bamboo breaking" sounds can be gone too even if they are in languages thousands of people are using everyday. I feel so little in front of the fact that I don't understand and can't use as comfortably those native expressions in Cantonese, instead I translate words from Mandarin when unsure. Some interesting examples can be found from Cantonese spoken by Guangdong and Hongkong. Here's one: fridge in Hongkong Cantonese: syut3 gwai6 雪櫃 (snow cabinet), fridge in Guangdong Cantonese: bing1 soeng1 冰箱 (ice box) -- the Guangdong Cantonese is just the literal translation of characters from Mandarin Chinese.

I found this a good guideline for translation: https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E4%BF%A1%E8%BE%BE%E9%9B%85
信达雅 -- faithfulness, expressiveness, and elegance
